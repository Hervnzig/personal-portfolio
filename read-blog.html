          When coronavirus-related stay-at-home orders were announced in the
          United States this past March, their durations were largely
          undetermined. But now, nearly four months later, as spikes of
          infections are being seen again across several states, it has become
          clear to the design world that changes to physical space must be made
          in order to stop COVID-19’s spread. Some employers are retrofitting
          close quarters with protective shields and hand sanitizing stations
          while others are considering new ways to use their existing office
          while staying socially distanced. For office workspaces in progress,
          some have begun asking their designers to revamp plans to accommodate
          distancing and safe collaborative work. Considering the current global
          health crisis, what is the future of workplace design? Three
          architects weigh in on how offices can remain safe after employees
          return to work.. When coronavirus-related stay-at-home orders were
